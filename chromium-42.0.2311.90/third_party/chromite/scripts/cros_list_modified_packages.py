"""Calculate what workon packages have changed since the last build.

A workon package is treated as changed if any of the below are true:
  1) The package is not installed.
  2) A file exists in the associated repository which has a newer modification
     time than the installed package.
  3) The source ebuild has a newer modification time than the installed package.

Some caveats:
  - We do not look at eclasses. This replicates the existing behavior of the
    commit queue, which also does not look at eclass changes.
  - We do not try to fallback to the non-workon package if the local tree is
    unmodified. This is probably a good thing, since developers who are
    "working on" a package want to compile it locally.
  - Portage only stores the time that a package finished building, so we
    aren't able to detect when users modify source code during builds.
