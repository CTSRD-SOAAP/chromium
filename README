This is the FreeBSD port of Chromium, corresponding to ports svn revision 325515.

You will need to prefix your ${PATH} with:
 * ${SOAAP_LLVM}/build/bin (for 'clang++', 'llvm-link', etc.)
 * ${SOAAP}/build/bin (for 'soaap')
 * ${SOAAP_CHROMIUM} (for 'llvm-file-map' and 'llvm-link-wrapper')

Currently, you also need to replace instances of '/home/kg365/...' in the
out/Release/build.ninja with paths that reflect your setup.

To build the bitcode version of chrome (chrome.bc), cd into

$ ninja chrome.soaap

To build an executable from chrome.bc, type:
