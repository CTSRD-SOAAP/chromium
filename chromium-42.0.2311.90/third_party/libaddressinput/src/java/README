Building and running tests with Android
=======================================

The easiest way to build libaddressinput for Android and run all the tests is
using the Gradle project automation tool:

http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system
http://www.gradle.org/

With an Android emulator running or an Android device connected, the following
command line then builds the library and runs the tests:

$ gradle connectedInstrumentTest

The test runner logs to the system log, which can be viewed using logcat:

$ adb logcat

Building and running tests with Java SE
=======================================

Large parts of the library and tests are not Android specific and those can be
built and run in a standard Java SE environment using the Ant build tool:

http://ant.apache.org/

The following command line then builds those parts of the library and runs the
corresponding tests:

$ ant junit

The test runner logs to XML files in the build/junitreport directory, which can
be formatted into human-friendly HTML (build/junitreport/index.html) like this:

$ ant junitreport
