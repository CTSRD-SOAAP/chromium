# This spec is used to prime the ConfigParser before reading any chroot specs.
#
# It can be thought of as the "superclass" of all chroot specs.
#
# It can refer to $(name)s to get the name of the chroot spec without the
# ".spec" suffix (AKA the subclass's name).
#
# Use RFC 822 format

# chromium source tree.  This is passed to make_chroot and enter_chroot as the
# --chroot option.
#
# DEFAULT: the name of the subclass spec file, without the suffix
path: %(name)s

# Flags to pass to make_chroot (other than --chroot).
