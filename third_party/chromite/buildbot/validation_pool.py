    If a transaction cannot be applied, then it is rolled back

    if an earlier attempt fails, that change can be retried in a new
    transaction if the failure wasn't caused by the patch being incompatible

        this is mainly of use for cbuildbot induced patching, and shouldn't
        be used for CQ patching.
      changes_filter: If not None, must be a functor taking two arguments:
        series, changes; it must return the changes to work on.
        This is invoked after the initial changes have been fetched,

    We use a fairly simplistic algorithm to calculate breakage: If you changed
    a package, and that package broke, you probably broke the build. If there
    were multiple changes to a broken package, we fail them all.

    Some safeguards are implemented to ensure that bad changes are kicked out:
      1) Changes to overlays (e.g. ebuilds, eclasses, etc.) are always kicked
         out if the build fails.
      2) If a package fails that nobody changed, we kick out all of the
         changes.
      3) If any failures occur that we can't explain, we kick out all of the
         changes.

    It is certainly possible to trick this algorithm: If one developer submits
    a change to libchromeos that breaks the power_manager, and another developer
    submits a change to the power_manager at the same time, only the
    power_manager change will be kicked out. That said, in that situation, the
    libchromeos change will likely be kicked out on the next run, thanks to
