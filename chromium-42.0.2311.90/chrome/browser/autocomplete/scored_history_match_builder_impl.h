// ScoredHistoryMatchBuilderImpl's Build method creates new history matches with
// a raw score calculated for the history item given in |row| with recent visits
// as indicated in |visits|. It first determines if the row qualifies by seeing
// if all of the terms in |terms_vector| occur in |row|.  If so, calculates a
// raw score.  This raw score is in part determined by whether the matches occur
// at word boundaries, the locations of which are stored in |word_starts|.  For
// some terms, it's appropriate to look for the word boundary within the term.
// For instance, the term ".net" should look for a word boundary at the "n".
// These offsets (".net" should have an offset of 1) come from
// |terms_to_word_starts_offsets|. |is_bookmarked| is used to determine if the
// match's URL is referenced by any bookmarks, which can also affect the raw
// score.  The raw score allows the matches to be ordered and can be/ used to
// influence the final score calculated by the client of this index.  If the row
// does not qualify the raw score will be 0.  |languages| is used to help
// parse/format the URL before looking for the terms.
