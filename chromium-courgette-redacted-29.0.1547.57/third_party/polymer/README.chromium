Description:
This directory contains a copy of polymer.min.js file. It is a minified version
of javascript library Polymer. Polymer is comprised of two efforts:
1. A set of core platform features (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, MDV).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As
browsers begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer
becomes smaller and better over time.
2. A next-generation web application framework built upon these core
technologies called the Polymer.

This is checked out from polymer stable branch. See build.log and README.md for
how the minified file is generated.
