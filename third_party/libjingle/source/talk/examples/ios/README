This directory contains an example iOS client for http://apprtc.appspot.com

Example of building & using the app:

cd <path/to/libjingle>/trunk/talk
- Open libjingle.xcproj.  Select iPhone or iPad simulator and build everything.
  Then switch to iOS device and build everything.  This creates x86 and ARM
  archives.
cd examples/ios
./makeLibs.sh
- This will generate fat archives containing both targets and copy them to
  ./libs.
- This step must be rerun every time you run gclient sync or build the API
  libraries.
- Open AppRTCDemo.xcodeproj, select your device or simulator and run.
- If you have any problems deploying for the first time, check the project
  properties to ensure that the Bundle Identifier matches your phone
  provisioning profile.  Or use the simulator as it doesn't require a profile.

- In desktop chrome, navigate to http://apprtc.appspot.com and note the r=<NNN>
  room number in the resulting URL.

- Enter that number into the text field on the phone.

- Alternatively, you can background the app and launch Safari.  In Safari, open
  the url apprtc://apprtc.appspot.com/?r=<NNN> where <NNN> is the room name.
  Other options are to put the link in an email and send it to your self.
  Clicking on it will launch AppRTCDemo and navigate to the room.
